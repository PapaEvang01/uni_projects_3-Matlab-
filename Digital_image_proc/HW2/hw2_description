HW2 – Progressive Image Fusion using wfusimg in YCbCr and HSV

This homework continues the topic of multi-image fusion by processing four different RGB images of the same outdoor scene (different from HW1), 
using MATLAB’s built-in wavelet fusion function `wfusimg`. Fusion is applied progressively across all four images, using two different color models: YCbCr and HSV.

🔹 1. YCbCr-based Fusion

The RGB images are first converted to the YCbCr color space. Fusion is applied on the Cr channel, which contains fine chromatic detail.

Steps:
1. Convert all 4 images from RGB to YCbCr.
2. Apply histogram equalization to the Y channel (luminance) to enhance contrast.
3. Perform progressive wavelet fusion on the Cr channel:
   - Fuse Image 1 and Image 2 → Cr_12
   - Fuse Cr_12 with Image 3 → Cr_123
   - Fuse Cr_123 with Image 4 → Cr_1234
4. Combine the final fused Cr result with the Y and Cb channels (from one of the original images).
5. Convert the fused YCbCr image back to RGB for display and saving.

📌 Fusion parameters:
- Wavelet: 'db6'
- Approximation method: 'max'
- Detail method: 'max'

🔹 2. HSV-based Fusion

Here, the RGB images are converted to HSV color space. Fusion is performed on the Saturation (S) channel, which captures color richness.

Steps:
1. Convert all 4 images from RGB to HSV.
2. Apply histogram equalization to the Value (V) channel to normalize brightness.
3. Perform progressive wavelet fusion on the S channel:
   - Fuse Image 1 and Image 2 → S_12
   - Fuse S_12 with Image 3 → S_123
   - Fuse S_123 with Image 4 → S_1234
4. Reconstruct the final HSV image using:
   - The fused S channel
   - H and V channels from any original image
5. Convert the final fused HSV image back to RGB.

🎯 Goal:

This project demonstrates an efficient method for performing multi-stage image fusion using MATLAB’s wavelet tools.
It also compares fusion results in two different color spaces, showcasing the visual and perceptual differences depending on the fusion strategy.
