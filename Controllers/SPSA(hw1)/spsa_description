Homework 1 ‚Äì SPSA-Based PID Controller Optimization
---------------------------------------------------
Course: Controllers (University-Level)
Topic: Control Systems + Optimization
Language: MATLAB

üìå Objective:
The goal of this assignment was to implement and optimize a PID controller for a second-order dynamic system using the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm.

We aimed to automatically tune the PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) to minimize the tracking error of the system response to a step input, while avoiding overshoot and long settling time.

üõ†Ô∏è What was implemented:
- A simulation model of a second-order system (mass-spring-damper style).
- A PID controller with anti-windup and saturation handling.
- A cost function based on ISE (Integral of Squared Error), settling error, and overshoot penalty.
- The SPSA algorithm for iterative gain tuning.
- A visualization of the system response after optimization.
- A logger to save the final results (PID gains and cost) into a `.txt` file.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Techniques Used:
- ODE45 for time-domain simulation
- SPSA (stochastic optimizer using only 2 cost evaluations per iteration)
- Gradient-free learning in constrained parameter space
- System output analysis (settling time, overshoot)

üß™ Output:
- Optimal PID gains (typically in [0, 1.5] range)
- A plot showing the system tracking a reference step
- Logged file containing:
    ‚Ä¢ Best PID gains
    ‚Ä¢ Final cost value
    ‚Ä¢ Timestamp of run

üéØ Skills Demonstrated:
- Control theory and simulation
- Parameter optimization
- Algorithm implementation (SPSA)
- MATLAB scripting and modular programming
- Result evaluation and automatic logging
