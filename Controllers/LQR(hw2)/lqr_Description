LQR Controller Design – Second-Order System
-------------------------------------------

This project implements an optimal state-feedback controller using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method to 
stabilize a second-order dynamic system modeled after a mass-spring-damper.

📌 Problem Statement:
We are given a continuous-time second-order system of the form:

    y'' + 2ζω_n y' + ω_n² y = u(t)

The goal is to design a controller that:
- Brings the system output y(t) to zero efficiently
- Minimizes both the state error and control effort

🛠️ Approach:
The system is first expressed in state-space form:

    ẋ = A·x + B·u

We then apply the LQR method to compute an optimal feedback gain K that minimizes the quadratic cost function:

    J = ∫ (xᵀQx + uᵀRu) dt

The control law is defined as:

    u(t) = -K·x(t)

✅ Outcome:
The result is a smooth and stable system response with minimal overshoot and control energy. 
The optimized gain matrix K and the simulation results are saved automatically to a .txt file for documentation.

🧰 Tools Used:
- MATLAB
- State-space modeling
- LQR control (`lqr` function)
- `ode45` for simulation
- Plotting and file logging

This assignment showcases optimal control design using LQR and contrasts with HW1, where PID control was tuned using SPSA.
