SPSA-Based PID Controller Tuning â€“ MATLAB Project

This MATLAB project demonstrates how to tune a PID controller using the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm. 

A second-order mass-spring-damper system is simulated in continuous time using ODEs. The goal is to minimize the tracking error to a step input using optimal controller gains.

Main Files:
- spsa_optimize_pid.m: Main script that runs SPSA and plots results
- spsa.m: SPSA optimizer implementation
- simulate_pid_response.m: Simulates PID response and returns error cost

Concepts:
- Control Systems (PID)
- Stochastic Optimization
- Numerical Simulation using ODE45

Result:
The system's output tracks the desired reference accurately after SPSA optimization.
